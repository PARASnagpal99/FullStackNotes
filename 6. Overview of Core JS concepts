- [ ] Javascript is a High-level prototype based Object oriented Multi paradigm interpreted or just-in-time compiled Dynamic Single Threaded Garbage collected Programming Language with first class functions and a non blocking event loop concurrency model .
- [ ] High Level language : Any computer program needs resources . In low level language like C developer has to manage resources manually but in high level languages like JS , everything happens automatically but there is a downside to it , high level languages can never be fast as low level languages like C .
- [ ] Garbage-collection : Automatic Garbage collection .
- [ ] MultiParadigm -> Paradigm : An Approach and mindset of structuring code , which will direct your coding style and technique .
Types of Paradigm in JS : 1. Procedural , 2. Object Oriented , 3. Functional Programming .
also IMperative vs Declarative .
- [ ] Javascript is prototype based object oriented . Everything except int or char is an object which has its own blueprint/prototype and methods and shows properties of OOPS .
- [ ] Javascript has First class functions which means that functions are simply treated as variables . We can pass it into other functions and return them from functions .
- [ ] Javascript is a dynamically typed language . No Data type defintions . Types becomes known at runtime . Data type of variable is automatically changed .
- [ ] Concurrency Model : How to JS engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time -> Why do we need that ? 
JS runs in one single thread . It can only do one thing at a time , so what About the long running Task ?
Sounds like it would block the single thread , however , we want non blocking behaviour .
How do We achive that ?
By Using a event loop : takes long running tasks , executes them in the background and puts them back in the thread when they are finished .
- [ ] JS engine : Program that executes JS code .
