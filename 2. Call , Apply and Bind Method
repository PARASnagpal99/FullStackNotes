1.
    Bind( )
   The bind method creates a new function and sets the this keyword to the specified object.
   Syntax : function.bind(thisArg, optionalArguments)

2. 
   Call ( ) : 
   The call method sets the this inside the function and immediately executes that function.
 
  The difference between call() and bind() is that the call() sets the this keyword and executes the function immediately and it does not create a new copy of the function,          while  the bind() creates a copy of that function and sets the this keyword.

   Syntax : function.call(thisArg, arg1, agr2, ...) 

   Call() also accepts a comma-separated list of arguments. The general syntax for this is function.call(this, arg1, arg2, ...)

  
3. Apply() 

The apply() method is similar to call(). The difference is that the apply() method accepts an array of arguments instead of comma separated values.
Syntax : function.apply(thisArg, [argumentsArr])
